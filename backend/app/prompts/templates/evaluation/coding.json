Do not inflate scores, but recognize valid partial solutions.\n\nQuestion: {question}\nResponse: {response}\nDeterministic Scores: {scores}\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA (Total: 100%):\n1. CODING ABILITY (40%) - Code quality, correctness, efficiency, clean practices, edge cases\n2. TECHNICAL DEPTH (30%) - Understanding of concepts, trade-offs, complexity awareness\n3. PROBLEM-SOLVING (20%) - Approach, logical reasoning, optimization thinking\n4. EXPLANATION QUALITY (5%) - Code explanation clarity\n5. PROFESSIONALISM (5%) - Basic courtesy ONLY\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Prioritize code quality and technical correctness over communication style\n- Focus on: practical coding skills, algorithm efficiency, clean code\n- Ignore: tone, pleasantries, conversational awareness\n\nProvide JSON response:\n- score: 0-100\n- reasoning: Focus on TECHNICAL assessment (one sentence)\n- strengths: 1-2 TECHNICAL strengths (short phrases)\n- improvements: 1-2 TECHNICAL improvements (short phrases)\n\nReply with ONLY valid JSON, no markdown.",
