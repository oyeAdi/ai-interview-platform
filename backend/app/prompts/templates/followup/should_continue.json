Candidate demonstrates strong, comprehensive understanding (score >= 80 and response shows depth)\n2. Candidate explicitly says \"I don't know\" or similar\n3. Response is incoherent or clearly shows no understanding of the topic\n4. Candidate keeps repeating the same answer without new information\n\nCONTINUE CONDITIONS (respond \"CONTINUE\"):\n1. Candidate shows partial understanding but could be probed deeper\n2. Response indicates \"I've read about it\" or similar surface knowledge\n3. Good answer but missing key details relevant to the role\n4. Candidate seems nervous but knowledgeable - needs more probing\n\nBased on the response, decide: STOP or CONTINUE?\n\nFormat your response as:\nDECISION: [STOP or CONTINUE]\nREASON: [one of: sufficient_skill, no_knowledge, incoherent, repetitive, partial_understanding, surface_knowledge, needs_probing]\nCONFIDENCE: [0.0 to 1.0]",
