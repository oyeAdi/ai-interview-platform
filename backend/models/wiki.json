      "answer": "The AI Interview Platform's backend *does not* utilize Spring Boot. It's built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI handles the core application logic, including receiving requests from the frontend (Next.js), managing interview flow, and interacting with the Large Language Model (LLM) via the `llm/` directory (specifically Gemini integration). The `core/` directory contains the `Interview controller` which orchestrates the interview process, and the `question manager` which handles question retrieval and sequencing.  `evaluation/` houses the logic for assessing candidate responses.  `strategies/` defines how the system determines appropriate follow-up questions. Data persistence is handled through JSON files in the `models/` directory. Essentially, FastAPI acts as the central nervous system, routing requests and coordinating the various components to deliver the interview experience.",

      "question": "How does a candidate matching work? what is the business logic?",
      "answer": "Candidate matching determines the suitability of candidates for open positions based on a scoring system. The core logic resides in `backend/main.py` within the `calculate_candidate_match_score` function. The process begins with a skill-based comparison. The system evaluates the overlap between skills *required* by the `position` and skills *possessed* by the `candidate`. Importantly, a primary language filter is applied – prioritizing candidates proficient in either Python or Java, as specified by the position. To improve matching accuracy, *partial skill matching* is implemented. This means related skills contribute to the score; for example, proficiency in Django positively impacts the Python skill match. Beyond skills, the system assesses *experience level alignment*. The degree to which a candidate’s experience matches the position’s requirements contributes to the overall score. Finally, these factors (skill match, language filter, partial matches, and experience alignment) are combined to generate a percentage match score between 0 and 100, representing the candidate’s overall suitability for the role. This score is then used to rank and present candidates.",

      "answer": "The skill weights used in the scoring system are dynamically determined by a Large Language Model (LLM) during the evaluation process. Specifically, when a job description is provided, the `Evaluator` class leverages the LLM to extract key skills and assign weights to each skill based on its importance as indicated within the job description. This process doesn't involve pre-defined, static weights. Instead, the LLM analyzes the job description text and generates a skill weighting dictionary. This dictionary maps each identified skill to a numerical weight, representing its relative significance for the role. These weights are then applied during keyword coverage and completeness scoring to calculate the overall candidate score. The LLM integration allows for a more tailored and context-aware evaluation, adapting to the specific requirements of each job.",

This score, determined by the `calculate_candidate_match_score` function in `backend/main.py`, considers several factors: skill overlap between the position requirements and the candidate's skills (including partial matching, like recognizing Django as a Python skill), alignment of experience levels, and a primary language filter (Python or Java). The resulting match score (a percentage between 0-100) is used to rank candidates. While the `InterviewController` in `backend/core/interview_controller.py` primarily *manages* the interview process itself (handling WebSocket communication, question delivery, and evaluation), it relies on this pre-calculated match score to determine which candidates are presented for interviews. The `InterviewController` doesn’t directly perform the matching; it *uses* the results of the matching process to orchestrate the interview flow.",

      "answer": "The AI Interview Platform’s business logic centers around orchestrating interviews from start to finish. It begins with user/position management handled on the frontend (Dashboard). When an interview is initiated, the backend's `core/` directory takes over. The `Interview controller` manages the interview state and flow, while the `Question manager` dynamically selects questions based on the interview stage and candidate responses. The platform leverages a strategy pattern for follow-up questions, implemented in `strategies/`. After a candidate responds, the `evaluation/` module assesses the answer, utilizing the Gemini LLM integration within `llm/` for AI-powered scoring and feedback. This evaluation informs the next question selection via the chosen strategy. Interview data, including questions and responses, is persisted using JSON storage in `models/`. The frontend's `Interview` component displays the interview interface for both candidates and administrators, consuming data via REST APIs and WebSockets defined in `main.py`. Essentially, the backend controls the interview *process*, while the frontend handles the *presentation* and user interaction.",

      "answer": "The candidate architecture centers around a scoring system to determine how well a candidate fits a given position. The core logic resides in `backend/main.py`, specifically within the `calculate_candidate_match_score` function. This function takes a `position` and a `candidate` as input and returns a match score between 0 and 100. The matching process begins with a primary language filter, prioritizing candidates proficient in languages specified by the position (currently Python or Java). Following this, a partial skill matching mechanism is applied. This allows for broader matches – for example, a candidate skilled in Django is considered a partial match for Python positions. Experience level alignment is then assessed, contributing to the overall score. The function combines these factors – skill match, language fit, and experience – to generate a percentage-based match score. This score represents the overall suitability of the candidate for the role. The system doesn't currently support weighting of these factors; all contribute equally to the final score.",
