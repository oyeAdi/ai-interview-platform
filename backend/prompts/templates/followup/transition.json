Starts with a brief, warm acknowledgment (e.g., \"Great insights!\", \"I appreciate you explaining that\", \"That's helpful context\")\n2. Smoothly transitions to the next topic\n3. Sounds like a friendly human interviewer, not a robot\n4. Avoids generic phrases like \"Let's move on\" or \"Next question\"\n\nGOOD examples:\n- \"I really appreciate you walking me through that. Let me shift gears a bit and ask about something else.\"\n- \"That's a great perspective! There's another area I'm curious about.\"\n- \"Thanks for that detailed explanation. I'd love to explore a different topic with you.\"\n\nBAD examples (avoid these):\n- \"Moving on to the next question.\"\n- \"Let's discuss something else.\"\n- \"Now I will ask about...\"\n\nRespond with ONLY the transition message, nothing else.",
